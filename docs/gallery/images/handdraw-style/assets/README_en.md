## How to Use This Skill

### 1. Smart Recommendation Mode (Zero Friction: No IDs Required)
If you don't want to browse through indexes, **simply describe what you want to illustrate**! The Skill analyzes your theme's mood, domain, and context, then **automatically pairs the best-matching hand-drawn style with an optimal classic monochrome theme color** (including an aesthetic rationale):
- *Zero-parameter prompt*: `Generate a prompt for a healing illustration of a cat sunbathing on a windowsill, pick the style and theme color for me (can combine)`
  > 💡 *Recommended Pairing*: Style `#018 · Minimal Deadpan Dialogue Cartoon` + Color `C-26 · Persimmon Orange` (Rationale: warm, comforting, and relaxed atmosphere), outputting production-ready bilingual prompts immediately.
- *Completion*: If you specify only a style (e.g., `Style 276, Theme: Future of AI`), the Skill auto-recommends a harmonious color (e.g., `C-01 Klein Blue`). If you specify only a color, it auto-recommends a fitting style.

### 2. Precise Manual Selection Mode (Choose Specific IDs)
1. Open the [Style Visual Sheet (STYLES_en.md)](STYLES_en.md), [Layout Visual Sheet (LAYOUTS_en.md)](LAYOUTS_en.md), or [Classic Monochrome Colors Sheet (COLORS_en.md)](COLORS_en.md) to browse visual sheets and pick your desired numbers;
2. Note your chosen ID, such as style `041`, layout `SC-001`, or theme color `C-01`;
3. Send your prompt command to the Skill, for example:
   - **Style only**: `Style: 041, Theme: First milk tea of autumn`
   - **Layout + Style**: `Layout: SC-001, Style: 041, Theme: First milk tea of autumn`
   - **With Theme Color**: `Layout: SC-001, Style: 041, Color: C-01, Theme: First milk tea of autumn`
4. Receive clean, copyable bilingual prompts with precise style definitions, layout geometry, and unified color palette;
5. Copy and paste into Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion, Flux, or any image generator to create your artwork.

### 3. AI Poster Design Mode (Structured Prompts, Native Integrated Layout)
Need to design festival campaign visuals, key art, or editorial social media posters? Simply tell the Skill your poster theme!
- **Prompt Command**: `请帮我出海报提示词， 主题：秋分` (or `Generate a poster prompt for me, Theme: Autumn Equinox`)
- **Intelligent Synergy**: The Skill analyzes the concept and pairs the best-matching hand-drawn style (e.g., `#268 · Contemporary Literati Ink Cartoon`) with classic theme colors (e.g., `Dominant: C-26 Persimmon Orange + Accent: C-03 Prussian Blue`). It outputs clean, structured prompts across **8 core design dimensions** (Theme, Scene, Audience, Density, Mood, Palette, Editorial Style, Hand-Drawn Style) with typography-composition integration guidelines.
- **Real Generation Showcase**: Passing the prompt directly to an image generation model (e.g., GPT Image 2/2.5) yields seamless native typographic layout and artistic metaphor fusion—large-character calligraphy title, poetic couplet inscriptions, seal stamps, balanced day-and-night imagery, and relaxed literati ink brushwork:

### 4. Pro Tips: The Universal Poster Mindset (Treat Infographics as High-Density Posters)
Feeling constrained by pre-canned infographic layouts? **Don't let rigid grids trap your imagination!**
The essence of an infographic is an information-dense visual poster. Simply tell the Skill your **time slots, core metrics, steps, and usage scenarios**; the model natively weaves timeline nodes, scenery illustrations, and typography into a cohesive editorial layout:
- **Travel Itineraries**: *Chiang Mai 5-Day Roaming (Day 1 Itinerary)* (Timed routes + landmarks + Northern Thai cuisine & tips)
- **Outdoor Gear Guides**: *Ultralight Mountain Camping Packing Guide* (3 core systems knolling lay flat + 8kg limit, workwear style)
- **Lifestyle Skills**: *Beginner Pour-Over Coffee Guide* (1:15 ratio + 3-stage pulse pouring timeline + flavor wheel)

## Two Prompt Modes, Instant Switching

Any number and theme can seamlessly toggle between two modes without changing your style:

- **Pure-Image Mode (纯图模式)**: Let the theme dictate pure pictorial content without in-image text. Ideal for pure illustrations, wallpapers, book covers, and concept art.  
  *Example*: `Pure-image mode, Style: 041, Theme: First milk tea of autumn`
- **Graphic-Text Mode (图文模式)**: Preserves your copy text and guides the AI to design metaphors and integrate typography harmoniously into the visual composition. Ideal for quote posters, meme graphics, and social cards.  
  *Example*: `Graphic-text mode, Style: 267, Theme: There are many things you couldn't figure out back then. Don't worry, give it some time and you might just forget about them.`

Switch modes anytime by typing *"switch to pure-image mode"* or *"switch to graphic-text mode"*. Defaults to pure-image mode when unstated.

### Graphic-Text Mode Demonstration

The illustration below shows text integrated harmoniously with the visual composition (this is a conceptual demonstration and not tied to any single number):

### Model Adaptation Mechanism

By default, the Skill crafts copyable prompts. When you explicitly request image generation, it optimizes the output based on verified model capabilities:

- **Explicitly Calibrated Models (e.g., `gpt-image-2`)**: Full activation hierarchy for all 280 styles: Style/Author Name → Positive Core Traits → Reference Image only when traits alone cannot reliably trigger the style, avoiding unnecessary image passing that might over-constrain the composition.
- **Third-Party & General Models (Midjourney, Flux, Stable Diffusion, Imagen, Gemini, etc.)**: Employs the rock-solid **Reference Image Fallback** strategy. The Skill provides a 1024x1024 4-grid standard reference image or file path, ensuring 100% faithful reproduction of linework, texture, and color palette without prompt drift.
- **Open for Community Benchmarks**: Capability definitions reside in `skills/handdraw-style-prompter/references/model_capabilities.json`. Pull requests for other model evaluations are warmly welcomed!
